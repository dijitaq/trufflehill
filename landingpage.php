				<h2>Our Chef Collections</h2>

				<blockquote>In fine, the truffle is the very diamond of gastronomy.</blockquote>
				<cite>Jean Anthelme Brillat. Savarin</cite>

				<p>Frequented by high profile chefs from around the world. All to experience the Black Perigord Truffle of the West for themselves. Our restaurant has played host to some of the finest, Ralf Bos is referred to by some as &ldquo;the gourmet food and truffle pope&rdquo; of Germany. To illustrate the value of a truffle better, he established a scale from 1-10. 10 is the highest rating and black truffles rated as 10 on that scale - there is nothing better in the world.</p>

				<p>After receiving Australian black truffles from Manjimup(Truffle Hill) instantly rating on this scale a 10.5. Therefore the months June to September are for Ralf Bos top Truffle Months. A high that kept us going for months.</p>

				<h2>The Farm</h2>

				<p>You always know when you come across someone who’s ventured into Truffle Hill, they certainly don’t talk about the place, they reminisce. Early morning mist across the valley, calls of [name] and [name] as they gently dig with paw covered silk mittens and the rather peculiar description of a golf ball shaped truffle.</p>

				<p>Although, there’s a lot more that goes into producing the Black Perigord Truffle from Truffle Hill as grand and as sort after as it still is today. It’s
everything from the quaint town in Western Australia called Manjimup, the stories of the Truffle Hunts, the sweet earthy aroma’s from fruity fungi, to the tantalising dishes that bring to life the real essence of the truffle in every single, aromatically pleasing dish that has the ability to heighten ones senses and create an atmosphere likened to that of an intoxicated group of life long friends, high on life and intoxicated on nothing but truffle.</p>

							<p>Since establishing in Manjimup, Western Australia in 1997, passion and dedication coupled with an extraordinary microclimate has seen Truffle Hill become the largest producer of superior black perigord truffles in the world and a premier truffi&egrave;re.</p>

							<p>The truffi&egrave;re (pronounced troo-fee-air) and vineyard at Truffle Hill is situated on 53 hectares of picturesque, undulating land surrounded by Karri and Jarrah forests. The truffière was established under the expert guidance of mycologist Dr Nick Malajczuk, who is recognised as a world authority on edible fungi.</p>

							<p>We produce Black Winter Truffles (Tuber melanosporum), which are known the world over as a rare and expensive gourmet delicacy. The first inoculated trees were planted in 1997 and 6 years later the first truffle was discovered, weighing in at 168g. Our truffle production has grown steadily over time, from 600kg in 2008 to more than 5,000kg. We export over 90% of our crop and supply the world’s best known restaurants. We produce roughly 60% of the total Australian production and have now become the largest single producer of Tuber melanosporum in the world.</p>

							<p>Truffle Hill works closely with truffle farmers, hunters and distributors from around the world to share knowledge, research and development - and of course, truffles. Through these relationships we’ve established worldwide recognition for the quality of our home-grown truffles and supply to more than 40 countries, including America, France, Italy, Japan, Singapore and Malaysia. We also distribute truffles from our international partners to maintain a steady, year-round supply, outside of the Australian season.</p>
