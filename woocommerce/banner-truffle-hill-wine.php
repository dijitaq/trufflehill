			<p>From very first beginnings of a truffle farm was the fable of thieves who would patiently wait for the harvest of the truffle treasure and sneak in the dark of night to pinch what they could in the way of truffle splendour. So truffle farmers would plant vines surrounding the oak trees to protect their truffle treasure. A tale that Truffle Hill have re-created, not for thieves but more for their love of wine. And let’s face it, “Wine by itself is a wonderful thing, but add truffle and it becomes mesmerising.” Mark Aitken, Truffle Hill Winemaker</p>
